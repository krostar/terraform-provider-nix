## Schema

### Required

- `store_path` (String) Store path to copy.
- `to` (String) URL of the destination Nix store (see [nix stores](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-help-stores) for possible values).

### Optional

- `check_sigs` (Boolean) Whenever paths should be signed by trusted keys.
- `from` (String) URL of the source Nix store (see [nix stores](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-help-stores) for possible values).
- `ssh_options` (List of String) SSH connection options (like `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, see [man ssh_config](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config) for possible values).
- `substitute_on_destination` (Boolean) Whether to try substitutes on the destination store (only supported by SSH stores). This causes the remote machine to try to substitute missing store paths, which may be faster if the link between the local and remote machines is slower than the link between the remote machine and its substituters.
